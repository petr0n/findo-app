# Findo
 
Findo is a "scavenger hunt meets bingo" app for the MN State Fair.

State Fairgoers are able to play a round of Findo while enjoying their food on a stick!  

Navigating to the app asks them to login with Google, Facebook or simply play as a guest.  From there, users must choose a kid-friendly or adult version for their board.  

After the game type is selected, 24 random tiles are presented similar to a BINGO board (free space and all). 

While trekking through the fair, as users see what's on a tile in real life, they mark it as found. Once they get 5 in a row, they win! It can be 5 in a row up, down or diagonal.

Users are also able to suggest new tiles that are reviewed and approved by admin users. 

The Admin capability lets privileged users add, edit and update tiles.
